### Bitcoin Last Halving cycle summary

![Bitcoin Last Halving](https://bitcoin-mantra.github.io/blogs/assets/img4/2020To2024Halving.png)

Halving Starts: May 2020 / 9K <br>
Halving Ends: Apr 2024 / 64K <br>
Max Price: 67K <br>
Dip Price: 16 K (due to FTX collapse) <br>

**Growth:** 5X (9*5 = 45K) should be ideal price but pump was due to FTX play (where X is BTC Start Value).
So, it also rebound back to 16K (ideally 25K to 30K drawdown should happen i.e. 3X)

### Bitcoin current Halving cycle calculation

![Bitcoin Current Halving](https://bitcoin-mantra.github.io/blogs/assets/img4/CurrentHalvingPlay.png)

Halving Starts: 2024 / 64K <br>
Halving Ends: 2028 / 300K <br>
Max Price: 250K to 300K <br>
Dip Price: 150K to 180K

**Avg. Growth** (where X is BTC Starting Value): 
<br>
Max 5X (300K)  <br>
Min 3X (180K) <br>

**Note:** Due to intituational adoption and Trump win w/ announcment of considering Bitcoin as US strategy reserve asset is bullish. Absense of FTX like negative sentiment in this cycle will not push values too low, but no one knows what events might occur in the future.

**Flat Growth per Yr.:**
2024: 60K > 
2025: 100K > 
2026: 150K > 
2027: 200K > 
2028: 250K <br>

The "1YR HODL Wave" refers to the distribution of Bitcoin holders who have held their Bitcoin for one year or more. Simply looking at it showing if price go up then long term hodler takes some profit and 1YR graph go down. 

Means Bitcoin price is inversly propostional to 1Yr+ Wave.
This metric is often used by analysts and investors to gauge the level of confidence and conviction in the Bitcoin market.

As the amount of bitcoins to be mined reduces over time, the stock to flow number (s2f ratio) increases, as supply coming onto the market is reducing. That is why this model is forecasting that the price of Bitcoin will increase in the future.
